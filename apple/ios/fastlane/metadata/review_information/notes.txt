This is complementary application to our web extension for checking product price history and real sale. 
Most useful scenario is with Share Action:

1. Open product detail (see exmaple URLs below) in browser or e-shop app (e.g. Alza.cz)
2. Share the product detail to Hlídač Shopů
3. Share Action with real discount and price history will pop up.

The app itself is PWA wrapped in WebView because of the lack of Share Target API support on iOS.

Here are some product detail URL links to test:
* https://www.alza.cz/iphone-6s-32gb-space-gray-d4463795.htm
* https://www.mall.cz/apple-airpods/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22zma
* https://www.czc.cz/apple-mac-mini-m1-8gb-512gb-ssd-8-core-gpu-big-sur-m1-2020/304130/produkt
